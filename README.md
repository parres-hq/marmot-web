# Marmot

Marmot is an open, end to end encrypted protocol that runs on a distributed relay network and stays fast and reliable. Keys define identity, not platforms.

## Build the Documentation Locally

In order to build the website locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22 (or basically the latest LTS version).

The setup is straightforward:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve locally (by default on port 8080)
npm start
```
