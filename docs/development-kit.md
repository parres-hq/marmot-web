### Why use Marmot Development Kit?

Marmot Development Kit is the official Rust implementation of the Marmot protocol. It gives you the core pieces for secure, end to end encrypted group messaging so you do not have to reimplement the protocol yourself.

<div>

Handles keys, groups, and message formats correctly

Wraps MLS in a clear, predictable Rust API

Works with multiple relays and clients out of the box

Favors small, composable building blocks, not a heavy framework

Built to be readable, testable, and production ready

### Other Implementations

Marmot is protocol first, not tied to a single library or language. The Rust Development Kit is the official reference, but there are other implementations that follow the same spec and interoperate with it. As the ecosystem grows, more language bindings and libraries can plug into the same network, all speaking the same protocol.

#### TypeScript

A TypeScript implementation of Marmot is available for browser and Node environments. It follows the same protocol spec as the Rust MDK and can interoperate with Rust-based clients.
