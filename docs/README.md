  - title: Sovereign identity
    details: End to end encryption powered by MLS, with forward secrecy and post-compromise safety. Keys are rotated and refreshed as membership changes, so even if a device is compromised, past messages remain protected and the group can heal itself. Encryption happens at the client, not on servers or relays. Privacy is guaranteed by cryptography, not policy.
  - title: Open network

Keys are rotated and refreshed as membership changes, so even if a device is compromised, past messages remain protected and the group can heal itself. Encryption happens at the client, not on servers or relays. There is no metadata-dependent trust model: relays do not see message contents, and there is no single point where security assumptions collapse. Privacy is guaranteed by cryptography, not policy."

  - title: Scales without central server
    details: Designed to stay responsive across many relays. Lightweight messages and efficient state sync keep communication quick. Clients can publish and read from several relays at once, taking the fastest path. If one is slow or down, another carries the traffic.
